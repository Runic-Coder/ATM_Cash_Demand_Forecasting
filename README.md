\# ATM Cash Demand Forecasting

This project was completed as part of an internship under YBI Foundation.

\## Project Overview 

This project predicts cash demand at ATM locations using Random Forest Regressor based on demographics, seasonality, and event data.



\## Project Goals 

\- Forecast ATM cash demand accurately

\- Recommend cash replenishment schedules

\- Optimize cash logistics using data



\## Files Included

\- `ATM\_Cash\_Demand\_Forecast\_for\_BankServe.ipynb` – Main notebook

\- `atm\_demand\_model.pkl` – Saved trained model

\- `requirements.txt` – Required Python libraries



\## Features Used

\- ATM type

\- Nearby population

\- Income level

\- Date \& season

\- Event/holiday flags



\## How to Run



```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```



Then open the notebook or script to run the model.



\## Model



The trained Random Forest model is saved as `atm\_demand\_model.pkl` and can be reused without retraining.
